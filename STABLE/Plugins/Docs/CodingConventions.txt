THREAD SYNCHRONIZATION
=============================================================================
- If there is a SynchronizationSupervisor::BeginXXXUpdate() method,
  then this method should be used to lock on a XXX variable type instead 
  of the lock statement
  - for example, if there is a BeginDescriptorUpdate() method, then 
    you should use this method to lock on a Descriptor typed variable
- If there is no associated method in the SynchronizationSupervisor class,
  then the lock statement should be used instead
- Previous two recomendations were introduced to ensure the coding consistency
  in the thread synchronization on types being frequently passed as arguments
