		buf: pointer to a string buffer
		cch: length of buffer
		shortName: if true, the driver should return a short but descriptive name, e.g. "3.xx profile"
		Affect: The database plugin must return a "friendly name" into buf and not exceed cch bytes,
			e.g. "Database driver for 3.xx profiles"
		Returns: 0 on success, non zero on failure
	
	int (*getFriendlyName) ( char * buf, size_t cch, int shortName );

	
		profile: pointer to a string which contains full path + name
		Affect: The database plugin should create the profile, the filepath will not exist at
			the time of this call, profile will be C:\..\<name>.dat
		Note: Do not prompt the user in anyway about this operation.
		Note: Do not initialise internal data structures at this point!
		Returns: 0 on success, non zero on failure - error contains extended error information, see EMKPRF_*
	
	int (*makeDatabase) ( char * profile, int * error );

	
		profile: [in] a null terminated string to file path of selected profile
		error: [in/out] pointer to an int to set with error if any
		Affect: Ask the database plugin if it supports the given profile, if it does it will
			return 0, if it doesnt return 1, with the error set in error -- EGROKPRF_* can be valid error
			condition, most common error would be [EGROKPRF_UNKHEADER] 
		Note: Just because 1 is returned, doesnt mean the profile is not supported, the profile might be damaged
			etc.
		Returns: 0 on success, non zero on failure

	Affect: Tell the database to create all services/hooks that a 3.xx legecy database might support into link,
		which is a PLUGINLINK structure
	Returns: 0 on success, nonzero on failure
	
	int (*Init) ( char * profile, void * link );

	
	Affect: The database plugin should shutdown, unloading things from the core and freeing internal structures
	Returns: 0 on success, nonzero on failure
	Note: Unload() might be called even if Init() was never called, wasLoaded is set to 1 if Init() was ever called.
